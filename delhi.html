      <h2>Good time to Visit</h2>
      <p>The best time to visit Delhi largely depends on your preferences regarding weather and events. Here are some general pointers:<br>

        1.<strong> Winter (October to March): </strong>This period is considered the best time to visit Delhi. The weather is pleasant during these months, with temperatures ranging from around 5°C (41°F) to 25°C (77°F). It's the peak tourist season as the climate is ideal for exploring the city without extreme heat. The city also hosts various cultural events, fairs, and festivals during this time.<br>
        
        2.<strong> Spring (February to March):</strong> Spring is also a good time to visit Delhi as temperatures begin to rise gradually, and the city blooms with colorful flowers.<br>
        
        3.<strong> Autumn (September to October): </strong>Just before winter, the weather is relatively pleasant, and the city is gearing up for festivals like Diwali, making it an exciting time to experience the cultural vibrancy of Delhi.<br>
        
        It's important to note that summer in Delhi (April to June) can be extremely hot with temperatures soaring well above 40°C (104°F), and the monsoon season (July to September) brings heavy rainfall and humidity. These periods might not be as comfortable for outdoor activities and sightseeing.</p>
